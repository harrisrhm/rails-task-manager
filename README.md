Rails Task Manager - Le Wagon

Let’s build a To Do Manager with the basic CRUD features:

As a user, I can list tasks
As a user, I can view the details of a task
As a user, I can add a new task
As a user, I can edit a task (mark as completed / update title & details)
As a user, I can remove a task
In this challenge, you will meet your old friend Active Record again, which is Rails’ ORM.
